            Karachi (/kəˈrɑːtʃi/; Urdu: کراچی; Sindhi: ڪراچي; IPA: [kəˈraːtʃi] (listen)) is the most populous city in Pakistan and 12th most populous city in the world, with a population of over 20 million.[17][18][19] It is situated at the southern tip of the country along the Arabian Sea coast. It is the former capital of Pakistan and capital of the province of Sindh. Ranked as a beta-global city,[20][21] it is Pakistan's premier industrial and financial centre,[22] with an estimated GDP of over $200 billion (PPP) as of 2021.[15][16] Karachi paid $9 billion (25% of whole country) as tax during fiscal year July 2021 to May 2022 according to FBR report. Karachi is Pakistan's most cosmopolitan city, linguistically, ethnically, and religiously diverse,[23] as well as one of Pakistan's most socially liberal cities.[24][25][26] Karachi serves as a transport hub, and contains Pakistan's two largest seaports, the Port of Karachi and Port Qasim, as well as Pakistan's busiest airport, Jinnah International Airport.[27] Karachi is also a media center, home to news channels, film and fashion industry of Pakistan. Most of Pakistan's multinational companies and banks have their headquarters in Karachi. Karachi is also a tourism hub due to its scenic beaches, historic buildings and shopping malls.

            The region has been inhabited for millennia,[28] but the city was formally founded as the fortified village of Kolachi as recently as 1729.[29][30] The settlement greatly increased in importance on arrival of the East India Company in the mid-19th century. British administrators embarked on substantial projects to transform the city into a major seaport, and connect it with the extensive railway network of the Indian subcontinent.[30] At the time of the partition of India in 1947, the city was the largest in Sindh with an estimated population of 400,000 people.[23] Following the independence of Pakistan, the city experienced a dramatic shift in population and demography with the arrival of hundreds of thousands of Muhajir (Urdu-speaking people) Muslim refugees from India,[31] coupled with a substantial exodus of its Hindu residents, whose numbers declined from 51.1% to 1.7% of the total population.[32][33] The city experienced rapid economic growth following Pakistan's independence, attracting migrants from throughout the country and other regions in South Asia.[34] According to the 2017 Census of Pakistan, Karachi's total population was 16,051,521, with 14.9 million of those people residing in the urban areas of the city. Karachi is one of the world's fastest-growing cities,[35] and has significant communities representing almost every ethnic group in Pakistan. Karachi holds more than two million Bengali immigrants, a million Afghan refugees, and up to 400,000 Rohingyas from Myanmar.[36][37][38]
            
            Karachi is now Pakistan's premier industrial and financial centre. The city has a formal economy estimated to be worth $190 billion as of 2021, which is the largest in the country.[39][40] Karachi collects 35% of Pakistan's tax revenue,[41] and generates approximately 25% of Pakistan's entire GDP.[42][43] Approximately 30% of Pakistani industrial output is from Karachi,[44] while Karachi's ports handle approximately 95% of Pakistan's foreign trade.[45] Approximately 90% of the multinational corporations and 100% of banks operating in Pakistan are headquartered in Karachi.[45] Karachi is considered to be Pakistan's fashion capital,[46][47] and has hosted the annual Karachi Fashion Week since 2009.[48][49]
            
            Known as the "City of Lights" in the 1960s and 1970s for its vibrant nightlife,[50] Karachi was beset by sharp ethnic, sectarian, and political conflict in the 1980s with the large-scale arrival of weaponry during the Soviet–Afghan War.[51] The city had become well known for its high rates of violent crime, but recorded crimes sharply decreased following a crackdown operation against criminals, the MQM political party, and Islamist militants, initiated in 2013 by the Pakistan Rangers.[52] As a result of the operation, Karachi dropped from being ranked the world's 6th-most dangerous city for crime in 2014, to 128th by 2022.[53]
